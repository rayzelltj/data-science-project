# Data Science Project on Pulsar Stars using Python
A Pulsar star is a rare type of rapidly rotating Neutron star renown for being extremely relevant for various areas of fundamental physics. Pulsar stars emit similar emission patterns, which can be used to distinguish between classifications. In this report, Pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey stored in the HTRU2 dataset will be used to classify candidates from a sample into pulsar or non-pulsar.  This machine learning tool used in the HTRU2 dataset is useful for efficiently interpreting large amounts of data to focus on scientific studies relating to pulsar stars. In this dataset, each candidate is described by 9 variables, including the classification variable. One set of mean, standard deviation, excess kurtosis, and skewness variables are statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile, and the other set of mean, standard, excess kurtosis, and skewness variables are obtained from the DM-SNR curve. To classify pulsar star data, specific variables which associate strongly can be used as predictors, which prompts the following question we aim to answer with this report:

“Can we use the skewness of the integrated profile and excess kurtosis of the integrated profile variables available to us to predict whether future star observations (with unknown diagnosis) show a non-pulsar or pulsar star?”
